##Summary 
There are over 2 orders of magnitude more unpaid nonVine reviews for the product in this analysis. Because of this, the percentage of 5 star Vine reviews is far more sensitive to the number of reviews compared to the nonVine. That said, the percentage of 5 star reviews for either Vine or nonVine is not great (~47% to ~51% respectively). Another analysis that could be performed on this dataset could be an average rating for both types of reviews as well as a distribution of reviews for each star review for Vine and nonVine.
